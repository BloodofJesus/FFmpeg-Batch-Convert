# FFmpeg-Batch-Convert
An FFMpeg bash script to batch convert video and audio files

Quick Note:  I recently branched off a dev branch and started work on a new interactive batch script (`FFmpeg-cron-conveter`), so the repo is a bit messy per instant, apologies.  However,  original project for that works for cron jobs, `FFmpeg-batch-converter`,  or one-off batch processing is still 100% functional though.  The readme file `README-FFmpeg-Batch-Convert.md` is well organized.

This project consists of two scripts: and interactive bash script for one-off batch processing `FFmpeg-Batch-Convert.sh` AND a cron job designed to silently mantain a media library according on schedule (for example nightly) `FFmpeg-Cron-Convert.sh`.
